## 1. `@Observable` Macro: Wrong Source Positions for Synthesized Accessors

**Symptom:** `redundantInternalAccessibility` warnings for properties in `@Observable` classes report `location.line` values that point to the *macro expansion* (small line numbers like 9, 13, 28), not the actual source line where the property is declared.

**Example:**
- `var playback: PlaybackState?` is at line 55 in `AppState.swift`
- Periphery reports its location as line 28 (the closing `}` of an earlier computed property)
- The offset (27 lines) corresponds to the number of lines in supporting types defined above the class

**Root cause:** The `@Observable` macro synthesizes storage properties (`_playback`, `_inspectorContext`, etc.) and accessor boilerplate. These synthesized declarations appear in macro expansion files (`@__swiftmacro_*.swift`). The indexstore records their location as being in the originating source file, but uses the line number from the expansion file — not the actual source line.

**Impact:** When Treeswift tries to insert `private` access modifiers at those locations, it targets the wrong lines (e.g., closing braces, blank lines, doc comments), producing syntactically invalid Swift.

**Fix applied:** `ObservableMacroRetainer` now suppresses `redundantInternalAccessibility` on all implicit backing storage properties (`_propName`), so those warnings are never emitted. The `insertAccessKeyword` guard (returns line unchanged when expected keyword not found) remains as a safety net for any edge cases not covered by the retainer.

**Affected declaration kinds:** `varInstance` properties inside `@Observable` classes — specifically the synthesized storage (`_propName`) entries.
